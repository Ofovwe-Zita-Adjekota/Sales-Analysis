# Sales-Analysis
### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the profit analysis of a sales company, and the performance of the sales reps in a month. By analyzing the cost price and selling price data, I sought to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the compnay's performance in the period .

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "data-for-practice, sheet 2" file from Excel Workbook, which contains daily data for the month of July by 2 sales reps.

### Tools
- Excel - For Data Cleaning
- Excel for Pivoting the Table
- Power BI - Creating Reports / Visualizations

### Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation stage, I carried out the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection,
- Handling missing values,
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Converting to the right data type
  
### Explanatory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

1. Did the company make a good profit in the month of July 2022?
2. What is the percentage profit compared to the percentage cost price?
3. Which sales rep made the highest profit in the month of July?
4. Are sales better during the day or at night?
5. Which shift records more profit, night or day?

### Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows:

- The company's profit for the month of July 2022 is over 10,000 dollars.
- From the profit percentage, we see it is way more than the cost price in that month.
- Jacob made more sales in July, with his sales being 51.65%.
- Sales during the day are better by the night.
- Despite the sales, total profits are higher from night sales

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following:

1. To improve sales, more sales should be carried out at night, as more profits were made.
2. Although Jacob made more sales overall, Ben had more daily maximum sales and should be commended.
   
### Limitation
Lack of data from the previous month to have a comparison of the profit made and performance of the sales reps.
